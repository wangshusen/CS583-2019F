Project
---------
Every student need to participate in a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions). 

- **Details**: [[click here](https://github.com/wangshusen/CS583A-2019Spring/blob/master/project/Project/proj.pdf)] and download.
   
- **Teamwork policy**: You had better work on your own project. Teamwork (up to 3 students) is allowed if the competition has a heavy workload; the workload and team size will be considered in the grading.

- **Grading policy**: See the evaluation form [[click here](https://github.com/wangshusen/CS583A-2019Spring/blob/master/project/Evaluation/Evaluation.pdf)]. An OK but not excellent work typically lose 3 points.
    
    
Alternatively, one can work on any deep learning research project and submit a research paper style report. Note that the requirement is much higher than a Kaggle project:

- It will be evaluated as if it is a research paper submitted to ICML/CVPR/KDD. If it does not have sufficient novelty and technical contribution, it will receive a low score.

- It cannot be a paper that published or posted on arXiv **before** the course begins. It is supposed done during this semester.




Textbooks
---------

**Required** (Please notice the difference between "required" and "recommended"):

- Francois Chollet. Deep learning with Python. Manning Publications Co., 2017. (Available online.)

**Highly Recommended**:

- S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe. Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra. Cambridge University Press, 2018. (Available online.)

**Recommended**:

- Y. Nesterov. Introductory Lectures on Convex Optimization Book. Springer, 2013. (Available online.)

- D. S. Watkins. Fundamentals of Matrix Computations. John Wiley & Sons, 2004.

Grading Policy
---------

**Weights**:

- Homework 40\%

- Quizzes 20\% (students' average score is likely around 17)

- Final 20\% (students' average score is likely around 16)

- Project 20\%  (students' average score is likely around 17)

- Bonus (7\% from bonus assignments; 3\% from HM4; 5\% from course project presentation.)


**Expected grade on record**:

- In the previous semester, the students' average scores in the quiz, final, and project are respectively 85\%, 80\%, and 85\%.

- Thus, an average student is expected to lose at least 3+4+3=10 points. 

- If an average student does not collect any bonus score, his grade on record is expected to be "B+".
An average student needs at least 3 bonus scores to get "A".

- According to Stevens's policy, a score lower than 73.0 will be fail.


**Late penalty**:

- Late submissions of assignments or project document for whatever reason will be punished. 2\% of the score of an assignment/project will be deducted per day. For example, if an assignment is submitted 15 days and 1 minute later than the deadline (counted as 16 days) and it gets a grade of 95\%, then the score after the deduction will be: 95\% - 2*16\% = 63\%.

- All the deadlines for bonus are firm. Late submission will not receive bonus score.

- Dec 20 is the firm deadline for all the homework and the course project. Submissions later than the firm deadline will not be graded.
